## Kubernetes Magicless

"Magic is when it is convenient and you do not understand what's going on."

So within this repository there is all the material to get a Kubernetes cluster up and running. This is not meant to be used in production or as a replacement for hosted solutions or nice setup tools. The purpose of this is educational. Going through all the steps manually helps understanding it. GCP is used for the infrastructure. So you will find quite some use of `gcloud` for bringing up instances and querying stuff.

This is (obviously) derived from https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way where you can also find more of a README.
